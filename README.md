# Libs used:  Selenium Java bindings - link: https://www.browserstack.com/automate/java
# Run Main.java file
#It took aprox. 2-3 hours, with being disturbed at home, for researching how to use Selenium and Browserstack, then 3-4 hours to finish all capabilities generation and creating test_cases. Also, running all methods took a lot of time, therefore I wanted to use selenium parallel execution, but it didn't work with JUnits.
